This is BikePower, a re-port of the original "bike_power" program by
Ken Roberts.

From the original description:

  This is a computer program called "bike_power", which calculates power
  output and power consumption for bicycling. You give it things like
  riding speed, body weight, hill grade, and wind speed. The program
  prints out a table with power output and power consumption, broken out
  in various ways.

Requirements                                                          

You need a modern perl (e.g. perl5.004 but older versions may work
too). If you want to use the Tk interface (and that's the only reason
why bother with this module), you need also Tk402.202. The modules
Data-Dumper and Tk-Pod are optional. All of these may be found at a CPAN site,
e.g. ftp://ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de/pub/lang/perl/CPAN/.

Installation

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Programs                                        

* bikepwr - a command line tool, similar to the original bike_pwr
* tkbikepwr - perl/Tk-interface for BikePower

Module BikePower.pm                                                     

The API is quite unstable, so there is no documentation yet.
